### Hi, I'm Katt!
I love animation, art, and cats. I'm also learning to code in Python!

I enjoy working on my Homeassistant setup, and am eager to to contribute to the community by creating intergrations. 

I'll say straight up that I use Cursor AI to help me code. Cursor implements my ideas, and I in turn I have said ideas, organise projects, make plans, and also stop it from destroying all the code it makes. 

Hopefully some of my projects come in handy for you!
